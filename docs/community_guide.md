# Community Guide

Welcome to the PROJECTNAME Community Guide!

> If your project is not going to have a docsite, the following information should be present in your project README as in the [README template](https://github.com/ansible-community/project-template/blob/main/README.md).

## Code of Conduct

We follow the [Ansible Code of Conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html) in all our interactions within this project.

If you encounter abusive behavior violating the Code of Conduct, please refer to the [policy violations](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html#policy-violations) section of the document for information on how to raise a complaint.
